There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  Mappr 

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  Quickly and painlessly visualize simple, location-based data sets.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  Use Mappr to quickly map large sets of geographic data. Whether you are working with addresses or lat/long data, throw it at mapper and watch it come to life through the magic of data visualization.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  Most data mapping / GIS tools are unnecessarily bloated and difficult to use. Why should you need to navigate some hugely complicated tool such as ArcGIS when all you want to do is make a map of the nearest bomb shelters?

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  Mappr solves this problem by focusing on providing a simple, yet flexible user experience that requires absolutely zero overhead to get started with. Just input your data (one at a time, or as a file), and let Mappr do the rest.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  Mappr makes it easy for users to get their data out there immediately *and* have it look amazing. It *just works!*

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  Just open up Mappr and start entering in your data, it's as easy as that. You don't even need to signup, though you should ;)

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  Mappr is awesome! We used it to map our data on US oil spills in a matter of minutes! Doing that the traditional way would have taken much longer and kept us from doing the work that really matters. 

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.

  Not impressed? Give Mappr a try and let us know what you think!
